        Let it be, let it be
        Let it be, let it be.
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

            And though the night is cloudy,
            There is still a light that shines on me,
            Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
            O, will I make up to the sound of music
            Mother Mary comes to me
            Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

            And when the broken hearted people
            Living in the world agree,
            There will be an answer, let it be.
            And though they may be parted there is
            Still a chance that they will see
            There will be an answer, let it be.

            When I find myself in times of trouble
            Mother Mary comes to me
            Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
            And in my hour of darkness
            She is standing right in front of me
            Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
